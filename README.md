# React training : Spotify

Quick training to get me into React again using **React 15.1**, **Webpack** (with hot reload module) and **NodeJS + Express** which is simply serving the html index.

Gets 10 tracks from Spotify API with track name or artist's name containing *hight* (which I randomly chosed)

Run `npm run serve` to run the NodeJS server and enable webpack hot reload.
